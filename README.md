**Build AI that thinks like you do.**

MindBridge AI is a semantic cognitive interface that allows users to embed their own reasoning, ethics, and doubt structure into open-source AI models.

---

## 🚩 Problem

Modern AI lacks interpretable, adaptable cognitive layers. Users can’t control how models reason — only what they output. That creates risk in sensitive areas (law, health, defense).

---

## 💡 Solution

MindBridge AI provides a structured semantic profile injected into LLMs:

- Binary ethical axis  
- Multilayer reasoning space (motivation, outcomes, logic)  
- Adaptive “Vector of Doubt”  
- Exportable JSON profile  
- Integration via API or prompt-injection into LLaMA, Mistral, etc.

---

## 🧩 Features

- Semantic engine with JSON schema  
- Interactive UI (in progress)  
- Log tracking + profile versioning  
- Modular layers + open-source format

---

## 🛠 Status

- ✅ Concept and architecture complete  
- ✅ Profile structure + schema defined  
- 🔧 MVP planned  
- 📬 Seeking funding and collaboration
