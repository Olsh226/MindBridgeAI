# ðŸ§  MindBridge AI â€” Architecture Overview

MindBridge AI provides a modular framework to represent, structure, and inject user thinking patterns into AI systems.

---

## 1. Semantic Profile Structure

Each userâ€™s cognitive profile includes:

- `ethical_axis` â€” binary core orientation (`good` vs `evil`)
- `semantic_layers` â€” vectors of reasoning dimensions (e.g., motivation, utility, outcomes, logic)
- `confidence` â€” how strongly a thought is held (0.0 to 1.0)
- `doubt_vector` â€” ability to reassess, shift, or generate alternatives
- `adaptation_rules` â€” when and how profiles evolve

---

## 2. Profile Engine

The profile is defined in JSON Schema and can be processed by:

- Front-end UI editor
- Python backend logic engine
- External LLM prompt integrator or API adapter

---

## 3. Thought Vector

The core of the system is a thought vector:



Where:
- `d` = ethical base
- `x` = semantic nuance vector
- `a` = confidence amplitude
- `s` = doubt vector

---

## 4. Integration with LLMs

MindBridge AI is model-agnostic and can be embedded via:

- System prompt construction
- Dynamic response filtering
- Fine-tuning via embedded profiles

Compatible with LLaMA, Mistral, Falcon, and more.

## 5. Security & Transparency

Profiles are open, verifiable, and version-controlled. Logs of changes allow tracking evolution of AI reasoning.
